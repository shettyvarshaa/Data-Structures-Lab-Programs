9 Lab programs in total

1. Design and Implement a program in C on Frequency Histogram, that builds a frequency array for data values 
  in the range 1 to n and then prints their histogram.
  The program should,
    a. Read, Store and Print the data in an array.
    b. Analyze the data in the array, one element at a time. Add 1 to the corresponding element in a frequency array 
      based on the data value.
    c. Print a histogram using asterisks for each occurrence of an element.

2. Design and Implement a program in C that simulates a mouse in a maze. The entrance spot, where the mouse 
  starts its journey, is chosen by the user who runs the program. It can be changed each time. 
  The sample maze is represented below:

    The program must print the path taken by the mouse from the starting point to the final point, including all 
    spots that have been visited and backtracked.
