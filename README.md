9 Lab programs in total

1. Design and Implement a program in C on Frequency Histogram, that builds a frequency array for data values 
  in the range 1 to n and then prints their histogram.
  The program should,
  
    a. Read, Store and Print the data in an array.
    
    b. Analyze the data in the array, one element at a time. Add 1 to the corresponding element in a frequency array 
      based on the data value.
      
    c. Print a histogram using asterisks for each occurrence of an element.
    

2. Design and Implement a program in C that simulates a mouse in a maze. The entrance spot, where the mouse 
  starts its journey, is chosen by the user who runs the program. It can be changed each time. 
  The sample maze is represented below:

    The program must print the path taken by the mouse from the starting point to the final point, including all 
    spots that have been visited and backtracked.

3. Design and Implement a program in C for the following Stack Applications,

    a. Evaluation of Suffix expression with single digit operands and operators: +, -, *, /, %, ^
    
    b. Conversion of Arithmetic Expressions
    
4. Design and Implement a program in C to categorize the data. Consider the following sample list of numbers

    Categorize and sort them into different groups as mentioned below:
    
      Group 1: Less than 10
      
      Group 2: Between 10 and 19
      
      Group 3: Between 20 and 29
      
      Group 4: 30 and greater
      
5. Design and Implement a menu driven program in C for the following operations on Doubly Linked List (DLL) 
    of Student Data with the fields: USN, Name, Dept, Marks, Phone Number
    
        a. Create a DLL of N Students Data by using end insertion.
        
        b. Display the status of DLL and count the number of nodes in it
        
        c. Perform Insertion and Deletion at End of DLL
        
        d. Perform Insertion and Deletion at Front of DLL
        
        e. Display the total and average marks for each student
        
6. Design and Implement a program in C for the following operations on Singly Circular Linked List (SCLL) 
   with header nodes,
   
    a. Represent and Evaluate a Polynomial P(x,y,z) = 6x^2y^2z - 4yz^5 + 3x^3yz + 2xy^5z - 2xyz^3.
    
    b. Find the sum of two polynomials POLY1(x,y,z) and POLY2(x,y,z) and store the result in POLYSUM(x,y,z).
